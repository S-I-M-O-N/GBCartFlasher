Mac build & install
=====================

Before installation you have to assure that you have installed g++ and QT4. libftdi and libusb is UNNECESSARY. in fact, libftdi may conflict with FTD2XX.. you need to install FTD2XX, available at:
http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm
It is easy to install, just follow the instructions...

This version was compiled for the first time with ftd2xx 1.0.4 for x64 (Snow Leopard). If you are using a different setup, please email me your results @ mbazzinotti@gmail.com

Process of building and installing under Mac is based on QT qmake program.
All the build configuration is saved in gbcf.pro file. This file is used by
qmake, to generate Makefile, which is later used by make tool to control build
and install.

Simplest way to compile this package is:

 1. `qmake` - this will produce Makefile needed by make
 2. `make` - starts the build process, generates moc files (needed by QT), 
 	compile and link sources and libraries into single executable file
 3. `make install` - copies files into certain directories (includes 
 	translations, executable and .conf files). In order to complete this
	command you need to have root rights, which you can get by calling sudo
	or su command before make install i.e. `sudo make install` or 
	`su -c "make install".

After that we have running copy of GameBoy Cart Flasher!

That's about it.
